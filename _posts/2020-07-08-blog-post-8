Alessia Carrara, an Erasmus exchange master student from the University of Milan, did her internship with Sergio Arredondo Alonso and me. 
The topic of her thesis was "A Machine Learning classifier for A. baumanii plasmids". She gave a presentation about her work at the 
Utrecht Bioinformatics Center (UBC) seminar.
