Cultivation of newly identified viruses to retrieve their genomic sequences is often difficult. 
Often, metagenomic approaches are used to identify complete viral genomes from sequence and for phylogenetic 
characterization of these new viruses. The *de novo* assembly of viruses from a metagenome is challenging, 
not only because of the lack of a reference genome, but also because of intrapopulation variation 
and uneven or insufficient coverage.
