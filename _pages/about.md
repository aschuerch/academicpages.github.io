I am a bioinformatician working in microbial genomics. My main research interest is to find patterns in complex sequencing data and to apply this knowledge to organisms causing infectious disease. In recent years, these patterns translated to sequence differences corresponding to transmission patterns in *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* strains; or to distinct physical entities, such as viruses in metagenome data or plasmids in WGS data. 

I am passionate about teaching and supervising, because I would like to share my enthousiasm for bioinformatics as a way to do hard tasks [better, faster, stronger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAjR4_CbPpQ).
