I am a bioinformatician working in pathogen genomics. I am heading a group 
that provides bioinformatics support for a medical microbiology department of an academic hospital. Our research interest is to find patterns in DNA sequencing data and to apply this knowledge to the genomic epidemiology of 
organisms causing infectious diseases. We are interested in the 
[genomics of plasmids](plasmidgenomics.md) and [other mobile genetic elements](mge.md). Previously, my interests included the [genomic typing of *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*](tb.md) during my phD, and the identification and [reconstruction of viruses from metagenome data](virus.md). We also design, write and maintain pipelines and databases for genomic or metagenomic analyses, carry out or advise on analysis of high-throughput sequencing data and provide bioinformatics education and consultation. 

I am passionate about teaching and supervising, because I like to share my enthousiasm for 
bioinformatics, open science and reproducible research as a way to do difficult tasks 
[better, faster, stronger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAjR4_CbPpQ). 
I teach university courses and [Carpentries workshops](https://carpentries.org/) as an instructor and trainer, 
and contribute to lesson development as a lesson maintainer for the [Data Carpentry Genomics lesson](http://www.datacarpentry.org/lessons/#genomics-workshop).
