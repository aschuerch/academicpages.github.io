I am a bioinformatician working in pathogen genomics. My main research interest is to find 
patterns in DNA sequencing data and to apply this knowledge to the genomic epidemiology of 
organisms causing infectious diseases. These patterns translated to sequence differences 
corresponding to transmission of *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* strains; or to distinct physical 
entities, such as the identification and reconstruction of viruses from metagenome data and the 
reconstruction of plasmids from bacterial whole genome short read sequencing data. 

I am passionate about teaching and supervising, because I like to share my enthousiasm for 
bioinformatics as a way to do difficult tasks 
[better, faster, stronger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAjR4_CbPpQ). 
I teach university courses and [Carpentries workshops](https://carpentries.org/) as an Instructor and Trainer, 
and contribute to lesson development as a lesson maintainer for the [Data Carpentry Genomics lesson](http://www.datacarpentry.org/lessons/#genomics-workshop).
